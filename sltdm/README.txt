CREDITS
-------

- Thanks to the many members of S|S, S||S, and countless others who have offered feedback (especially Jacen!), created maps, and provided inspiration for this mod.

- This mod was inspired by my love for the Shocklance. Thanks to the T2 developers for creating such an awesome weapon, and an awesome game!

- Based on or inspired by code from Arena, DuelMOD, and Tribes2 Deathmatch.

CLIENT INSTALLATION
-------------------

There is a separate client available (SLTDMClient.vl2) that shows an improved objective hud. The client is optional, but if you want to use it, you should download it to your Tribes2\Gamedata\base folder and restart Tribes 2.

SERVER INSTALLATION
-------------------

Place the SLTDM.vl2 and SLMaps.vl2 files in your Tribes2\GameData\base folder and restart the Tribes2 server. After restart, a prefs file (prefs/SLTDMPrefs.cs) will be created. Stop the server, edit the prefs file, then restart the server. Many of the prefs file settings can also be changed by vote or by admin in-game. See the prefs file for more details.
