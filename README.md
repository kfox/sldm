### SLDM Client Installation (Optional)

There is a client archive available ([SLDMClient.vl2](https://github.com/kfox/sldm/releases/latest/download/SLDMClient.vl2)) that shows an improved objective hud. The client is optional, but if you want to use it, you should download it to your Tribes2\Gamedata\base folder and restart Tribes 2.

If you want to play offline against bots, you can download the server and maps ([SLDM.vl2](https://github.com/kfox/sldm/releases/latest/download/SLDM.vl2) and [SLMaps.vl2](https://github.com/kfox/sldm/releases/latest/download/SLMaps.vl2)) to your Tribes2\GameData\base folder and restart Tribes2.

### SLDM Server Installation

Place the [SLDM.vl2](https://github.com/kfox/sldm/releases/latest/download/SLDM.vl2) and [SLMaps.vl2](https://github.com/kfox/sldm/releases/latest/download/SLMaps.vl2) files in your Tribes2\GameData\base folder and restart the Tribes2 server. After restart, a prefs file (prefs/ShocklanceDMPrefs.cs) will be created. Stop the server, edit the prefs file, then restart the server. Many of the prefs file settings can also be changed by vote or by admin in-game. See the prefs file for more details.
